# Laptop-Price-Predictor-using-Random-Forest

This project predicts the price of a laptop based on its features (like RAM, processor type, and storage) using a machine learning model called Random Forest.

What This Project Does
-> Predicts Laptop Prices: You input laptop features, and the model gives an estimated price.
-> Uses Random Forest: This model is a type of machine learning that works well with complex data.
